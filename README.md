# Complex Networks

## Description

This repository contains the solution of 24 exercises about complex networks separated in 4 lists:
* **List 1**: exercises about building a network and taking some basic measures.
* **List 2**: taking centrality measures, degree correlation and detecting communities.
* **List 3**: analyzing the different networks models to build a network.
* **List 4**: dynamical processes in networks (failure and attack simulations).

There are pdf files with more information inside of each "listX" folder.

## Tech stack
* Python (NetworkX, Matplotlib, NumPy, Pandas)
* Jupyter Notebook
