# Complex Networks

## Description

This repository contains the solution of 24 exercises about complex networks separated in 4 lists:
* **List 1**: building a network and taking some basic measures.
* **List 2**: taking centrality measures, degree correlation and detecting communities.
* **List 3**: analyzing the different networks models to build a network.
* **List 4**: dynamical processes in networks (failure and attack simulations).

There are pdf files with more information inside of each "listX" folder.

## Usage

To run this project you need to use Python 3. You also need to install NetworkX. The used version of NetworkX was 2.3.

To run every python script in this project, enter the folder where the script is and do something like this:
```
    python ex1.py
```
Here we moved to the folder [list1/ex1](list1/ex1) and we ran this command. Do something similar to the other python scripts you want to run.

You can also open the notebooks (the .ipynb files) using Jupyter    Notebook.

## Tech stack
* Python (NetworkX, Matplotlib, NumPy, Pandas)
* Jupyter Notebook
