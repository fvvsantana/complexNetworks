    "Another interesting result is the discrepance between the Average degree and the Second moment of the degree distribution of the Facebook network. In a non-scale-free network, we can expect that the value of $(AverageDegree)^2$ is in the same order of the **Second moment of the degree distribution**. But in a scale-free network like the Facebook's network, the value of the **Second moment of the degree distribution** is way bigger than the $(AverageDegree)^2$."
