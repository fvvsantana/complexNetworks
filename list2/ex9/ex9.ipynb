    "We can see that the Louvain method had the best results in modularity among the tested methods. The Fast Greedy method also did a good job on the E-road and Neural networks, but in the US airport it had a bad performance.\n",
    " Indeed, the US airport network had the worst performance among all the networks. It was easier for most of the methods to detect the communities in the E-road network, because it's a big-world network (given the average shortest path), so you don't have edges crossing distant communities. For the US airport network and the Neural Network, the measures are almost the same. So, in order so try to explain it, we calculated the Average Clustering Coefficient and the Transitivity of these networks. As we can see, the average clustering coefficient and the transitivity are way bigger in the US airport than in the Neural Network. This level of clustering probably causes confusion in the algorithms because it's hard to separate the clusters.\n",
