#| Here we create a process to run the main function. The advantage of using this strategy, instead of directly invoking main(), is that it gives us more control to stop the program.
#| If we set the useTimer variable at the beginning of the program to True, the timer will stop the main process after 60 seconds. It's useful when we hit Ctrl+C in the terminal and the program refuses to stop.
#| Also, it's important to catch the KeyboardInterrupt exception, that is raised when we hit Ctrl+C.
#| By default, Ctrl+C would kill our program and the process that we've created would still continue to run.
#| When we catch the exception, we also terminate the process of the function main. This way, Ctrl+C works again.

#| Now we can see the beautiful community detection with colors. For the Neural Network, it's visible that the Girvan Newman's method and the label propagation detection method had a bad modularity for the networks, because they classified almost all nodes in the same class. While with Louvain and Fast Greedy methods, we see well defined classes with reasonable modularity.
#| Using the same criteria, it's visible when the methods had good modularity on the US airport network and when they didn't.
